# Lab 02
## Author: Declan Sheehan [dsheehan1.gulls.salisbury.edu]
### Description: This lab is meant to help learn how to implement OOP in Python, along with learning how to use matplotlib, override functions, and more.
### In the lab, I create two classes (Vector and Geometry) in which I use both to create polygons (using matplotlib) and run different tests to determine
### if the shape is open or closed, and whether a point lies inside of the shape.
