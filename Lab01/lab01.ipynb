    "- B: You could probably scrape the internet or use data from databases on different songs, genre, and artists. You can then place different songs under many different categories based on this solid information. If we did not know what category to place the songs under, you can automate a Python program to learn off of many amounts of data. The libraries used for this are: Pytorch.\n",
    "- C: Classifying different songs and artists into multi-classes, and storing it to a database would probably be the best way to allow for on-demand classification. This classification method could hold values of how similar a song is to different genres from 0.00 to 1.00 I do not know what you specifically mean by \"strategy\", but I think this way would be pretty suitable."
